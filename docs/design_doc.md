# Vector Database Implementation Notes for Claude Desktop Plugin
(Updated with Contextual Retrieval Implementation)

## Vector Database Selection

### Requirements
1. Must support local deployment
2. Must support hybrid search (both vector similarity and text/BM25)
3. Python client library
4. Production-ready and well-maintained

### Hybrid Search Capabilities
There are two approaches to implementing hybrid search:

1. **Single Hybrid-Capable DB**
   - Pros:
     - Simpler architecture
     - Fewer moving parts
     - Easier deployment
     - Single point of maintenance
   - Cons:
     - Less control over search algorithms
     - May be less tunable

2. **Separate Specialized DBs**
   - Pros:
     - More control over each search type
     - Can tune each independently
   - Cons:
     - More complex architecture
     - Need to maintain multiple systems
     - More challenging deployment

### Selected Approach
For the Claude Desktop plugin, we'll use a single hybrid-capable vector database to minimize complexity. Top candidates:

- **Qdrant**
  - Rust-based, excellent performance
  - Built-in hybrid search with BM25-like scoring
  - Local deployment via file-based storage
  - Strong Python SDK
  - Active development

- **Alternative Options**
  - Weaviate: Supports hybrid search but requires Docker
  - Milvus: Good hybrid search but deployment is more complex

### Selection Criteria
1. Data scale requirements
2. Filtering and query complexity needs
3. Resource constraints
4. Programming language preferences

## Integration Strategy

### Using Llama Index
Llama Index provides an ideal framework for implementing vector storage in the Claude Desktop plugin due to:

1. **Focused Scope**: Unlike LangChain, Llama Index specializes in data operations and RAG
2. **Core Features**:
   - Data ingestion and structuring
   - Vector store management
   - Query routing
   - Built-in evaluation tools
   - Streaming and async support

3. **Vector Store Support**:
```python
from llama_index.vector_stores import (
    ChromaVectorStore,
    QdrantVectorStore, 
    WeaviateVectorStore,
    FaissVectorStore,
    PineconeVectorStore
)
```

4. **Basic Implementation**:
```python
from llama_index.vector_stores import VectorStoreQuery
from llama_index.schema import TextNode

# Initialize store
chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
chroma_collection = chroma_client.create_collection("your_collection")
vector_store = ChromaVectorStore(chroma_collection=chroma_collection)

# Add documents
nodes = [
    TextNode(text="some text", id_="node1"),
    TextNode(text="other text", id_="node2")
]
vector_store.add(nodes)

# Query
query = VectorStoreQuery(query_embedding=[0.1, 0.2, ...])
results = vector_store.query(query)
```

### Key Advantages for Plugin Development
1. Clean separation between data and LLM operations
2. Native async support
3. Modular architecture - can use vector store components independently
4. Active development and documentation
5. Built-in batching for performance
6. Robust metadata filtering support
7. Strong typing and IDE support

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Flow
1. Document ingestion
2. Embedding generation
3. Vector storage
4. Similarity search
5. Result retrieval

### Error Handling
- Handle connection failures gracefully
- Implement retry logic for database operations
- Validate input data before storage
- Handle missing or corrupt embeddings

### Performance
- Use batching for bulk operations
- Implement connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed vectors
- Monitor memory usage

### User Configuration
- Allow vector store selection
- Configurable embedding dimensions
- Adjustable similarity thresholds
- Persistence options

## Contextual Retrieval Implementation

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- Split documents into manageable chunks (few hundred tokens)
- Generate contextual descriptions using Claude:
  ```
  <document> 
  {{WHOLE_DOCUMENT}} 
  </document> 
  Here is the chunk we want to situate within the whole document 
  <chunk> 
  {{CHUNK_CONTENT}} 
  </chunk> 
  Please give a short succinct context to situate this chunk within the overall document for the purposes of improving search retrieval of the chunk. Answer only with the succinct context and nothing else.
  ```
- Prepend context to each chunk before indexing

### 2. Dual Indexing System
- Create and store semantic embeddings of contextualized chunks in vector DB
- Build BM25/TF-IDF index on raw text of contextualized chunks
  - BM25 works on actual text, not vectors
  - Looks at term frequency, document length, and inverse document frequency
  - Complements vector search by finding exact matches
- Need two types of storage:
  1. Vector DB for embeddings (semantic search)
  2. Text index for BM25 (lexical search)
- Ensure both indexes support efficient querying
- Note: Both indexes work with the same contextualized chunks, just indexed differently

### 3. Retrieval Pipeline
1. Query Processing:
   - Search vector DB for semantic similarity matches
   - Search BM25 index for exact matches
   - Combine and deduplicate results
2. Optional Reranking:
   - Use reranker model (e.g., Cohere) to improve relevance
   - Score and filter top results
3. Return top-K chunks (recommended K=20)

### 4. System Configuration Parameters
- Chunk size and overlap settings
- Embedding model selection (recommended: Gemini or Voyage)
- Reranking configuration
- Number of chunks to return (K value)
- Contextualization prompt template

### Performance Considerations
- Contextual Embeddings reduce retrieval failure by 35%
- Combining with Contextual BM25 reduces failure by 49%
- Adding reranking further reduces failure (up to 67%)
- Balance between reranking more chunks for accuracy vs. fewer for speed

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic vector store wrapper using Llama Index
2. Add configuration options for store selection
3. Implement error handling and logging
4. Add performance monitoring
5. Create user documentation
